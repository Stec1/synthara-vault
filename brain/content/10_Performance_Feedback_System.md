# Performance Feedback System (v1.0)

## Purpose
To evaluate post effectiveness and refine Synthara’s strategy.

## Metrics Layer

### Instagram
- Views
- Watch time %
- Saves
- Shares
- Comments quality
- Profile visits

### X
- Impressions
- Bookmark rate
- Replies depth
- Follower conversion

## Signal Evaluation

For each post:
- Did alpha prediction age well?
- Was thesis correct?
- Was timing optimal?
- Did audience understand?

## Content-Type Performance Tracking

Track performance by:
- Format (Reel / Carousel / Thread)
- Topic (Onchain / AI / Macro)
- Tone (Cold analytical / Slight irony / Deep thesis)

## Learning Loop

If performance > baseline:
→ Increase similar signal density

If performance < baseline:
→ Re-evaluate signal threshold
→ Re-evaluate narrative framing

## Feedback Logging

Every published post must:
→ Be logged in [[91_Decision_Log]]
→ Be linked back to [[09_Signal_Intake_Form]]

## Monthly Review

Create monthly review note:
- Top 3 best signals
- Top 3 failed theses
- Pattern recognition notes
- Adjustment plan
