# 31 — X Thread Playbook (v1)

## Purpose
X = credibility layer. Threads are receipts-first.

## Cadence
- 2 threads/week (deep)
- 1–2 replies/day (surgical, factual)

## Thread Template (6–10 tweets)
1) Hook: structural claim
2) Thesis: what is happening
3) Receipts: 2–3 bullets
4) Interpretation: who/why now
5) Misread: what crowd gets wrong
6) Risk/invalidation
7) Watch next 24–72h
8) Close: question to builders/analysts (not retail hype)

## Reply Rules
- short, calm, factual
- no ego fights
- if “targets?” → redirect to invalidation/watchlist

## Publishing Standard
- Every claim needs either a receipt or explicit uncertainty.
- Keep tone analytical; avoid dunking, rage bait, and certainty theater.
- Prefer fewer threads with stronger evidence.

## Workflow Links
- Thesis base: [[07_Cognitive_Core]]
- Draft queue: [[13_Draft_Generator_Engine]]
- Packaging + QA: [[08_Post_Assembly_Line]]
- Persona calibration: [[15_Brain_Profile_From_Questionnaire]]
