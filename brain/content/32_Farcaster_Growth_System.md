# 32 — Farcaster Growth System (v1)

> [!quote] Positioning
> Farcaster = “crypto-native credibility layer”. IG = “mass-market theatre”.

## 1) Goal
Turn Synthara into a **recognized onchain intelligence voice**:
- consistent, calm, receipts-based
- low frequency, high signal
- community loops → distribution → holders (later)

## 2) Posting Cadence (realistic baseline)
- **Daily:** 1–2 short casts (micro-signal / framing)
- **Weekly:** 2 deep casts (thread-style)
- **Event-driven:** only if signal passes gates

## 3) Cast Types (templates)
### A) Micro Signal (3 lines max)
HOOK:
THESIS:
WATCH (24–72h):

### B) Receipts Cast (bullet proof)
Signal:
Receipts:
- 
- 
Risk/Invalidation:
- 
Watch:
-

### C) “Most people misread” Cast
Most people think: ___  
Actually: ___  
Watch: ___  
Invalidation: ___

### D) Bridge-to-IG Cast
“Full breakdown in IG carousel/reel: (topic).”
(never spam; only after strong signal)

## 4) Engagement Rules (how Synthara comments)
- Replies are short, surgical, factual
- No debates, no ego fights
- If asked “buy?” → redirect to risk framing and invalidation
- If attacked → either silence or 1-line receipt

## 5) Growth Loop (weekly)
- [ ] Identify 10 relevant accounts (builders/analysts)
- [ ] Reply 3–5 times/day with receipts (not opinions)
- [ ] Re-cast 1 high-signal post/day
- [ ] Convert 1 strong signal into IG reel/carousel per week
- [ ] Track top posts → replicate pattern

## 6) KPIs (simple)
- Saves/bookmarks proxy: “people asking follow-up”
- Recasts
- Qualified replies (“what wallets?” “what invalidation?”)
- Profile clicks (if available)

## 7) Bridge to Synthara OS
Input sources for Morgana (sentiment) and Strategist:
- Use casts as “narrative layer receipts”
- Strong narrative shift becomes a candidate signal → [[09_Signal_Intake_Form]]

## 8) What NOT to do
- Don’t shill tokens
- Don’t copy other analysts
- Don’t post 10 times/day
- Don’t chase memes unless they carry structural info
