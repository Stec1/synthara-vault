# 30 — IG Reels System (v1)

## Strategy
IG = mass-market theatre for high-signal ideas.
Goal: convert attention → trust → followers.

Operating principle: low frequency, high clarity, evidence-backed.

## Cadence (from profile)
- 2 deep posts/week (Reel/Carousel)
- 4 short impulses/week (quick reel / story / micro insight)

## Reel Types (pick 1)
A) Thesis Reel (30–45s) — default  
B) Micro insight (10–15s) — impulse  
C) Q&A Reel — answer one sharp question

## Hook Rules
- 1 line max
- no hype words
- create cognitive dissonance (“Most people misread…”)

## CTA Rules
- Ask for “what to watch next” style questions
- Avoid “buy/sell”

## Posting Checklist
- [ ] Claim matches [[07_Cognitive_Core]]
- [ ] Draft originated in [[13_Draft_Generator_Engine]]
- [ ] Reel produced via [[22_Higgsfield_Reels_SOP]]
- [ ] Final QA in [[08_Post_Assembly_Line]]
- [ ] Language keeps receipts over noise

## Performance Review (weekly)
Track:
- Saves/share ratio
- Qualified comments (builders/analysts)
- Follow conversion from deep reels

Cut formats that generate reach without trust.
