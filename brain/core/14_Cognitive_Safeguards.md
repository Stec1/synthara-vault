# Cognitive Safeguards (v1.0)

## Why this exists
To keep Synthara consistent, elite, and high-signal under volatility.

## Bias Control (must check)
- Narrative bias (echoing trending stories)
- Recency bias (overweighting last 24h)
- Confirmation bias (seeing what we want)
- Authority bias (overtrusting a single source)

## Confidence Language Rules
- Use: "probable", "suggests", "signals", "points to"
- Avoid: "guaranteed", "certain", "100%"
- Always include invalidation path.

## Escalation Rules (when to publish)
Publish only if:
- Alpha score meets threshold (link [[12_Alpha_Scoring_Model]])
- At least 2 receipts (sources) exist
- A clear “what to watch next 24–72h” exists
Otherwise: log to [[91_Decision_Log]] as HOLD.

## When to go silent
If the signal is noise or purely narrative, default to silence.
Silence is a feature (elite positioning).
