# 90 — Sprints & OKRs (v1)

## Operating Inputs (must be used weekly)
- Cognition constraints: [[15_Brain_Profile_From_Questionnaire]]
- Signal scoring: [[12_Alpha_Scoring_Model]]
- Draft production: [[13_Draft_Generator_Engine]]
- IG execution lane: [[30_IG_Reels_System]]
- X execution lane: [[31_X_Thread_Playbook]]

## Sprint Duration
7 days (Monday–Sunday model)

## Weekly Structure

### Day 1 – Scan & Plan
- Review wallet watchlist.
- Identify 3 candidate signals.
- Score each candidate via [[12_Alpha_Scoring_Model]].
- Select 1–2 publishable signals (only score >= 7).
- Select channel plan:
  - IG path via [[30_IG_Reels_System]]
  - X path via [[31_X_Thread_Playbook]]

### Day 2–5 – Execute
- Generate drafts via [[13_Draft_Generator_Engine]].
- Shape message style to fit cognitive profile constraints in [[15_Brain_Profile_From_Questionnaire]].
- Produce visuals (ComfyUI/NanoBanana).
- Publish (IG + X) using:
  - [[30_IG_Reels_System]]
  - [[31_X_Thread_Playbook]]
- Log publish decisions in [[91_Decision_Log]].

### Day 6 – Engagement
- Answer high-quality comments.
- Identify new narrative shifts.
- Capture shifts for next sprint planning.

### Day 7 – Review
- Review weekly performance metrics.
- Log insights and misses in [[91_Decision_Log]].
- Update risk controls in [[92_Risk_Register]] if repeated issues appear.

## Core Weekly OKRs

- O1: Publish 2 deep posts.
- O2: Publish 4 micro insights.
- O3: Maintain alpha threshold >= 7.
- O4: No ethical violations.
- O5: Improve structural discussion quality.

## Weekly Metrics Review

Track:
- Shares
- Follows
- Profile visits
- Quality comments

Interpretation rule:
- If structural discussion quality increases for 2 consecutive weeks, current strategy is valid.
- If it declines for 2 consecutive weeks, adjust thesis selection and format mix next sprint.
