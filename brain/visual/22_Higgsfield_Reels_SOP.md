# 22 — Higgsfield Reels SOP (v1)

## Purpose
Convert a strong thesis into a calm, high-signal reel.

## Default Reel Specs
- Length: 30–45s
- Tempo: calm, confident
- Camera: handheld-lite or steady cinematic (no slowmo gloss)

## Script Structure (Synthara style)
1) Hook (1 line)
2) Thesis (1 line)
3) Receipts (2–3 bullets)
4) What most people misread (1 line)
5) Risk/Invalidation (1–2 lines)
6) Watch next 24–72h (2 bullets)

## Production Steps
- [ ] Pull thesis and receipt stack from [[13_Draft_Generator_Engine]]
- [ ] Choose format: talking-head / b-roll overlay / scene acting
- [ ] Generate keyframes (if needed)
- [ ] Add captions (tight, minimal)
- [ ] Export 1080x1920
- [ ] Pass through [[08_Post_Assembly_Line]] before publishing

## Quality Rules
- Face not too close
- No uncanny smoothing
- Lighting consistent with “quiet confidence”
- Voiceover/subtitles stay factual (receipts over noise)
