# 40 — Token Utility Architecture (v1)

> Synthara does not sell signals.  
> Synthara monetizes structure.

## Core Principle
Token utility is linked to:
- access to structured reasoning
- early structural notes
- gated intelligence layers

NOT:
- buy/sell alerts
- target prices
- pump mechanics

## Utility Tiers

### Public Layer
- 2 deep posts/week
- 4 micro signals
- partial reasoning

### Insider Layer (Gated)
- Extended intake reasoning
- Full wallet explanation
- Risk matrix overlay
- Early weekly alpha report

### Node Layer (Future)
- Raw candidate signals
- Watchlist updates
- Research notes before publishing
- AI query credits

---

## Token Value Anchor

Value tied to:
- signal quality (Alpha >= 7)
- performance credibility
- structured insight access
