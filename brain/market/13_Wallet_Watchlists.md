# 13 — Wallet Watchlists (v1)

## Purpose
Maintain a curated list of wallets to detect structural behavior.

## Watchlist Types
1) Smart Money (tracked labels / consistent behavior)
2) Builders / Deployers (contracts, deployments, infra)
3) Distribution Risk (historical exit patterns)
4) Sector Specialists (AI infra / Base ecosystem)

## Minimal Fields (per wallet)
- Label / Name:
- Chain(s):
- Why tracked:
- Typical behavior:
- Risk pattern (how they exit):
- Tags: (smartmoney / builder / risk / ai-infra / base)

## Weekly Maintenance (10–20 min)
- [ ] Add new candidates from signals
- [ ] Remove noisy/unreliable wallets
- [ ] Update behavior notes after major moves
- [ ] Link key events into [[91_Decision_Log]]

## How it feeds content
When a tracked wallet triggers a signal:
- Log via [[09_Signal_Intake_Form]]
- Score via [[12_Alpha_Scoring_Model]]
- Draft via [[13_Draft_Generator_Engine]]
