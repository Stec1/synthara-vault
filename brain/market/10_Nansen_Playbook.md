# 10 — Nansen Playbook (Synthara Intelligence v1)

> [!quote] Synthara rule
> Receipts over noise. Structural > narrative.

## 1) Purpose
Convert Nansen signals into **publishable intelligence**:
- Smart Money movements
- Liquidity rotation
- Token/contract anomalies
- “What most people misread”

## 2) Operating Routine (Daily)
- [ ] **Morning scan (15–25 min)**: macro + flows + anomalies
- [ ] **Midday check (10 min)**: confirm/deny early signal
- [ ] **Pre-publish verification (10–15 min)**: receipts + invalidation

## 3) Signal Categories (what we track)
### A) Smart Money Flow
- New positions (first entry)
- Scale-in (accumulation)
- Scale-out (distribution)
- Rotation (midcaps → majors, sector shifts)

### B) Liquidity / Market Structure
- Liquidity vacuum
- Thin orderbook conditions
- Volume absorption vs rejection
- Volatility expansion after compression

### C) Token / Contract Alerts
- Hot contracts
- Unusual interaction spikes
- New deployments with traction
- Suspicious churn patterns

## 4) “Receipts” Standard (required evidence)
Minimum receipts before we draft content:
- **2 independent confirmations**, e.g.
  - wallet behavior + volume/structure
  - smart money flow + contract spike

Receipt examples (write in plain language):
- “3 tracked wallets added across 6h, avg entry clustered near …”
- “Contract interactions up X% vs baseline”
- “Rotation visible: majors inflow + midcap depth drops”

## 5) Intake Output → must fill [[09_Signal_Intake_Form]]
> [!tip] Use this as the bridge
> Nansen signal is NOT content. It becomes intake.

### Copy-Paste Intake Skeleton
**Signal name:**  
**Chain:**  
**Category:** (Smart Money / Liquidity / Contracts)  
**Raw observation (3 bullets):**
- 
- 
- 
**Receipts (min 2):**
- 
- 
**Hypothesis (1 sentence):**  
**What most people misread (1 line):**  
**Risk / invalidation (2 bullets):**
- 
- 
**Next 24–72h watchlist (3 bullets):**
- 
- 
- 

## 6) Decision Gate (publish vs hold)
Publish only if:
- [ ] Receipts ≥ 2
- [ ] Clear invalidation exists
- [ ] “What to watch” exists
- [ ] Score will likely meet [[12_Alpha_Scoring_Model]] threshold

If not:
- Log as HOLD in [[91_Decision_Log]]

## 7) Output Hand-off
After intake is complete:
- Generate drafts using [[13_Draft_Generator_Engine]]
- Enforce safeguards via [[14_Cognitive_Safeguards]]
- Route through [[08_Post_Assembly_Line]]
