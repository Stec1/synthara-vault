# Draft Generator Engine (v1.1)

## What this is
A repeatable generator spec that turns a completed [[09_Signal_Intake_Form]] into a structured draft following [[07_Cognitive_Core]] and [[08_Post_Assembly_Line]].

## Inputs (must be present)
- Completed [[09_Signal_Intake_Form]]
- Alpha score reference: [[12_Alpha_Scoring_Model]]
- Risk rules: [[92_Risk_Register]]
- Format rules: [[05_Content_Matrix]]

## Output (what this produces)
- 3 draft variants:
  1) Analytical (default)
  2) Provocative-lite (subtle edge, no hype)
  3) Educational-minimal (A+B style: elite + partial teaching)
- Each variant outputs:
  Hook (1 line) → Thesis → Evidence bullets → Interpretation → Risk/Invalidation → Watchlist (24–72h) → CTA (non-financial-advice)

## Generator Steps (checklist)
- [ ] Step 1: Extract signal (1 sentence)
- [ ] Step 2: Write structural thesis (1 sentence)
- [ ] Step 3: Attach receipts (3 bullets max)
- [ ] Step 4: Smart money read (1–2 lines)
- [ ] Step 5: What most people misread (1 line)
- [ ] Step 6: Risk + invalidation (2 bullets)
- [ ] Step 7: What to watch next 24–72h (3 bullets)
- [ ] Step 8: Choose format template (Reel/Carousel/Thread)
- [ ] Step 9: Produce 3 variants
- [ ] Step 10: Final gate check (from [[08_Post_Assembly_Line]])

## Style Enforcement (hard rules)
- No hype tone, no “guaranteed”, no “100%”.
- Calm authority, minimal words.
- Max 1 metaphor per draft.
- Always include invalidation.
- Always include “receipts” (evidence bullets).
- Keep it low-frequency, high-signal.
